# Installation

Nuxt.js is really easy to get started with. A simple project only needs the nuxt dependency.

## Using create-nuxt-app

To get started quickly, the Nuxt.js team has created scaffolding tool create-nuxt-app.

Make sure you have npx installed (npx is shipped by default since NPM 5.2.0)

```bash
$ npx create-nuxt-app <project-name>
```
